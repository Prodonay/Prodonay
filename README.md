Paulo Ramos de Oliveira - Aspiring data analyst

Passionate about uncovering stories behind data, I'm transitioning my career to data analysis. I'm currently improving my R skills and looking for interesting projects to collaborate on. I'm open to opportunities as a Jr. Data Analyst to put my knowledge into practice. I also have an IT support certificate from Google and Coursera. I'm learning 2 more programming languages: Python and Javascipt.
